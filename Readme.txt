The New Blueline WordPress theme is a remake of Blueline, which was developed by www.gpsgazette.com at around 2004.

It is a simple three column theme using a soft color scheme.

There are two sidebars, one to the left of the content and one to the right. Both sidebars are fixed width while the content area will adjust depending on the window size.

Both sidebars are widget ready.

The original Blueline is discontinued for a very long time and cannot be found from the official WP theme repository already.

It is released under a GPL licence, however I would appreciate it if you leave the footer credits.
